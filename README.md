# postgres-test
testing python libs for postgres

## Libraries


### pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/

I'm not going to go over what it does, but it makes dealing with the data the sql scripts return really easy.
Also makes running SQL files super read_sql_query

### psycopg2
https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/


Using this to connect to postgres. Similar to pandas, makes it super easy to do.
